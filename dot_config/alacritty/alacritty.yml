# Alacritty doesn't create the config file for you,
# but it looks for one in the following locations:
#
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml
# $HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml
# $HOME/.alacritty.yml
#
# Vi Mode
# Moving around viewport and scrollback using Ctrl+Shift+Space.
# To copy, you can either use a mouse to select and press Ctrl+Shift+c,
# or enter Vi mode ecs - v - hjkl - y. To paste, press Ctrl+Shift+v.
# To copy/paste to/from X clipboard:
# use a mouse selection to copy  and a middle mouse click to paste.
#
# Search
# Search in Alacritty's scrollback buffer.
# Search forward using Ctrl Shift f and backward using Ctrl Shift b.
#
# Vi Search
# / for forward and ? for backward search
# The SearchStart and SearchEnd keybinding actions can be bound
# if you're looking for a way to jump to the start or the end of a match.
#
# Normal Search
# jump between matches using Enter and Shift Enter.
# After leaving search with Escape your active match stays selected,
# allowing you to easily copy it.
#
# Hints

# Feeds to an external application / triggers one of alacritty's built-in actions.
# triggered using the mouse or vi mode cursor.
# Hints can be configured in the hints and colors.hints sections in config.
